== Overview

This project implements a method for density-based uncertainty estimation in machine learning models. The approach quantifies prediction certainty based on the density around data points and integrates with various ML algorithms to enhance model reliability.

== Features

- Density map generation using Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation.
- Integration with logistic regression, random forest, and other ML models.
- Uncertainty quantification and visualization of prediction confidence.
- Evaluation of uncertainty measures and comparison with traditional methods.

== Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- [Additional dependencies, if any]
