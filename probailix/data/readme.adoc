== Uncertainty-based estimation for calibrated systems

The main contributions of this project to the thesis are:

- The development of a density-based uncertainty estimation method tailored to calibrated systems.
- A comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness using real-world datasets.
- A detailed comparison of computational trade-offs with traditional uncertainty estimation methods.

The results and insights from this research are documented in the accompanying thesis, which can be found in the file `../bachlorarbeit.pdf`.
